# OASIS INFOBYTE LANDING PAGE
 Landing page launchpad: I had designed a captivating landing page for a Hoverboards from Back to the Future fictional product, by focusing on clear messaging, eye catching visual and a compelling call to action. I had also used my CSS skills to create a visually stunning and responsive layout, added columns, divide sections, arranged items, added header and footer. Most importantly, I used creativity to make the page look impressive. The alignments, the padding, the color palette, boxes and all the other elements on the page required attention.
